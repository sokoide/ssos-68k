## Build

### Environment Setup

Set the required environment variables:

```bash
export XELF_BASE=/path/to/your/cloned/elf2x68k/m68k-xelf
export PATH=$XELF_BASE/bin:$PATH

# Source the environment (recommended)
. ~/.elf2x68k
```

### OS Build (Bootable Disk)

Build the complete bootable operating system:

```bash
cd ssos
make clean  # Required when switching between targets
make
# Output: ~/tmp/ssos.xdf (bootable disk image)
```

Boot from the generated XDF file in your X68000 emulator:

![ssos](./docs/ssos.png)

### Standalone Development Build

For faster development iteration, build as a standalone Human68K executable:

```bash
cd ssos
make clean  # Required when switching between targets
make standalone
# Output: ~/tmp/standalone.x (executable for Human68K)
```

### Additional Build Commands

```bash
make compiledb      # Generate compile_commands.json for LSP support
make dump           # Disassemble the binary for debugging
make readelf        # Show ELF file information
make clean          # Clean all build artifacts
```
