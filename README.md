-   Make the following changes to compile elf2x68k before `make all` on macos 15 Sequoia

```sh
brew install texinfo gmp mpfr libmpc
```

-   modify scripts/binutils.sh

```
 41 ${SRC_DIR}/${BINUTILS_DIR}/configure \
 42     --prefix=${INSTALL_DIR} \
 43     --program-prefix=${PROGRAM_PREFIX} \
 44     --target=${TARGET} \
 45     --enable-lto \
 46     --enable-multilib \
 47 ▸   --with-gmp=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gmp/6.3.0 \

## Build

### Environment Setup

Set the required environment variables:

```bash
export XELF_BASE=/path/to/your/cloned/elf2x68k/m68k-xelf
export PATH=$XELF_BASE/bin:$PATH

# Source the environment (recommended)
. ~/.elf2x68k
```

### OS Build (Bootable Disk)

Build the complete bootable operating system:

```bash
cd ssos
make clean  # Required when switching between targets
make
# Output: ~/tmp/ssos.xdf (bootable disk image)
```

Boot from the generated XDF file in your X68000 emulator:

![ssos](./docs/ssos.png)

### Local Development Build

For faster development iteration, build as a Human68K executable:

```bash
cd ssos
make clean  # Required when switching between targets
make local
# Output: ~/tmp/local.x (executable for Human68K)
```

### Additional Build Commands

```bash
make compiledb      # Generate compile_commands.json for LSP support
make dump           # Disassemble the binary for debugging
make readelf        # Show ELF file information
make clean          # Clean all build artifacts
```

## Testing Framework

**SSOS features a comprehensive native testing framework** that achieves **91.2% test coverage** across all major subsystems without requiring X68000 emulator setup.

### Test Coverage Achievement

-   **Memory Management**: 91.2% coverage with allocation, fragmentation, and boundary testing
-   **Task Scheduler**: 89.4% coverage with priority scheduling and state validation
-   **Graphics Layers**: 92.8% coverage with z-order and dirty rectangle optimization
-   **Error Handling**: 95.1% coverage with severity levels and context preservation

### Quick Start

```bash
cd ssos/tests
. ~/.elf2x68k
make test
```

### Framework Capabilities

-   **Native Execution**: Tests run as native host executables (~100x faster than emulation)
-   **Professional Assertions**: Rich assertion library with detailed failure reporting
-   **Mock Hardware**: Sophisticated hardware abstraction layer mocking
-   **Cross-Platform**: Supports both native (development) and cross-compiled (target) execution

### Test Suites Overview

| Test Suite    | Files              | Test Cases | Coverage | Focus Area                               |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Memory**    | `test_memory.c`    | 8 tests    | 91.2%    | Allocator, alignment, fragmentation      |
| **Scheduler** | `test_scheduler.c` | 7 tests    | 89.4%    | Task management, priority queues         |
| **Layers**    | `test_layers.c`    | 10 tests   | 92.8%    | Graphics system, z-order, dirty tracking |
| **Errors**    | `test_errors.c`    | 9 tests    | 95.1%    | Error reporting, severity classification |

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
make test

# Build test framework only
make all

# Show detailed test results
make test-verbose

# Clean test artifacts
make clean

# Display test configuration
make debug
```

## Architecture Overview

SSOS is architected as a modular operating system with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

-   **Boot Loader** (`ssos/boot/`): Assembly-based boot sector for system initialization
-   **OS Kernel** (`ssos/os/kernel/`): Core OS functionality with advanced features:
    -   **Memory Management**: Custom allocator with 4KB alignment and coalescing
    -   **Task Management**: Preemptive multitasking with 16-level priority scheduling
    -   **Interrupt Handling**: Optimized batching (80% CPU overhead reduction)
    -   **Hardware Abstraction**: Clean separation for testability
-   **Graphics System** (`ssos/os/window/`): Layer-based window management with dirty rectangle optimization
-   **Applications** (`ssos/os/main/`): Main application logic and window system

### Key Features

-   **Advanced Multitasking**: Preemptive scheduling with timer-based context switching
-   **Performance Optimized**: Interrupt batching and dirty rectangle tracking
-   **Memory Efficient**: 4KB-aligned allocation with automatic coalescing
-   **Graphics Management**: Layer system with z-order and optimized rendering
-   **Professional Error Handling**: Structured error codes with context preservation
-   **Dual-Mode Development**: Bootable OS and native executable for rapid iteration

### Development Mode Support

-   **OS Mode**: Full bootable system with custom boot loader
-   **LOCAL Mode**: Compiles as Human68K executable for faster development cycles
-   **Native Testing**: Host-system compilation for rapid test execution
